# 1.8.0

* Major API change: Remove defaults for collections. This fixes a major design flaw - when parsing a document a collection would be reset to `[]` even if it is not present in the parsed document.



## Definition

* Make `Definition < Hash`, all options can/should now be accessed with `Definition#[]`.
* Make `Definition::new` the only entry point so that a `Definition` becomes a *immutual* object.
* Deprecated `#options` as the definition itself is a hash (e.g. `definition[:default]`).
* Rename `#sought_type` to `#deserialize_class`.
* Removed `#default`, `#attribute`, `#content`.
* `#from` is replaced by `#as` and hardcore deprecated.
* `#name` and `#as` are _always_ strings.


-> constantize :class etc (requires AS)
-> make all options lambda-able
-> make major steps lambda-able
-> strategies for deserialization (lambda-able!)


h2. 1.7.7

* Parsing an empty hash with a representer having a wrap does no longer throw an exception.
* `::nested` now works in modules, too! Nests are implemented as decorator representer, not as modules, so they don't pollute the represented object.
* Introduce `:inherit` to allow inheriting+overriding properties and inline representers (and properties in inline representers - it starts getting crazy!!!).

h2. 1.7.6

* Add `::nested` to nest blocks in the document whilst still using the same represented object. Use with `Decorator` only.
* Fixing a bug (thanks @rsutphin) where inline decorators would inherit the properties from the outer decorator.

h2. 1.7.5

* propagate all options for ::property to ::inline_representer.

h2. 1.7.3

* Fix segfaulting with XML by passing the document to nested objects. Reported by @timoschilling and fixed by @canadaduane.

h2. 1.7.2

* `Representable#update_properties_from` is private now.
* Added the `:content` option in XML to map top-level node's content to a property.

h2. 1.7.1

* Introduce `Config#options` hash to store per-representer configuration.
* The XML representer can now automatically remove namespaces when parsing. Use `XML::remove_namespaces!` in your representer. This is a work-around until namespaces are properly implemented in representable.

h2. 1.7.0

* The actual serialization and deserialization (that is, calling `to_hash` etc on the object) now happens in dedicated classes: `ObjectDeserializer` and friends. If you used to override stuff in `Binding`, I'm sorry.
* A new option `parse_strategy: :sync`. Instead of creating a new object using the `:class` option when parsing, it uses the original object found in the represented instance. This works for property and collections.
* `Config` is now a hash. You may find a particular definition by using `Config#[]`.
* Properties are now overridden: when calling `property(:title)` multiple times with the same name, this will override the former `Definition`. While this slightly changes the API, it allows overriding properties cleanly in sub-representers and saves you from manually finding and fiddling with the definitions.

h2. 1.6.1

* Using `instance: lambda { nil }` will now treat the property as a representable object without trying to extend it. It simply calls `to_*/from_*` on the property.
* You can use an inline representer and still have a `:extend` which will be automatically included in the inline representer. This is handy if you want to "extend" a base representer with an inline block. Thanks to @pixelvitamina for requesting that.
* Allow inline representers with `collection`. Thanks to @rsutphin!

h2. 1.6.0

* You can define inline representers now if you don't wanna use multiple modules and files.
<!-- here comes some code -->
```ruby
property :song, class: Song do
  property :title
end
```

This supersedes the use for `:extend` or `:decorator`, which still works, of course.

* Coercion now happens in a dedicated coercion object. This means that in your models virtus no longer creates accessors for coerced properties and thus values get coerced when rendering or parsing a document, only. If you want the old behavior, include `Virtus` into your model class and do the coercion yourself.
* `Decorator::Coercion` is deprecated, just use `include Representable::Coercion`.
* Introducing `Mapper` which does most of the rendering/parsing process. Be careful, if you used to override private methods like  `#compile_fragment` this no longer works, you have to override that in `Mapper` now.
* Fixed a bug where inheriting from Decorator wouldn't inherit properties correctly.

h2. 1.5.3

* `Representable#update_properties_from` now always returns `represented`, which is `self` in a module representer and the decorated object in a decorator (only the latter changed).
* Coercion in decorators should work now as expected.
* Fixed a require bug.

h2. 1.5.2

* Rename `:representer_exec` to `:decorator_scope` and make it a documented (!) feature.
* Accessors for properties defined with `decorator_scope: true` will now be invoked on the decorator, not on the represented instance anymore. This allows having decorators with helper methods.
* Use `MultiJson` instead of `JSON` when parsing and rendering.
* Make `Representable::Decorator::Coercion` work.

h2. 1.5.1

* Make lonely collections and hashes work with decorators.

h2. 1.5.0

* All lambdas now receive user options, too. Note that this might break your existing lambdas (especially with `:extend` or `:class`) raising an `ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)`. Fix this by declaring your block params correctly, e.g. `lambda { |name, *|`. Internally, this happens by running all lambdas through the new `Binding#represented_exec_for`.

h2. 1.4.2

* Fix the processing of `:setter`, we called both the setter lambda and the setter method.

h2. 1.4.1

* Added `:representer_exec` to have lambdas be executed in decorator instance context.

h2. 1.4.0

* We now have two strategies for representing: the old extend approach and the brand-new decorator which leaves represented objects untouched. See "README":https://github.com/apotonick/representable#decorator-vs-extend for details.
* Internally, either extending or decorating in the Binding now happens through the representer class method `::prepare` (i.e. `Decorator::prepare` or `Representable::prepare` for modules). That means any representer module or class must expose this class method.

h2. 1.3.5

* Added `:reader` and `:writer` to allow overriding rendering/parsing of a property fragment and to give the user access to the entire document.

h2. 1.3.4

* Replacing `json` gem with `multi_json` hoping not to cause trouble.

h2. 1.3.3

* Added new options: `:binding`, `:setter` and `:getter`.
* The `:if` option now eventually receives passed in user options.

h2. 1.3.2

* Some minor internal changes. Added `Config#inherit` to encasulate array push behavior.

h2. 1.3.1

* Bringing back `:as`. For some strange reasons "we" lost that commit from @csexton!!!

h2. 1.3.0

* Remove @:exclude@ option.
* Moving all read/write logic to @Binding@. If you did override @#read_fragment@ and friends in your representer/models this won't work anymore.
* Options passed to @to_*/from_*@ are now passed to nested objects.

h2. 1.2.9

* When @:class@ returns @nil@ we no longer try to create a new instance but use the processed fragment itself.
* @:instance@ allows overriding the @ObjectBinding#create_object@ workflow by returning an instance from the lambda. This is particularly helpful when you need to inject additional data into the property object created in #deserialize.
* @:extend@ and @:class@ now also accept procs which allows having polymorphic properties and collections where representer and class can be chosen at runtime.

h2. 1.2.8

* Reverting all the bullshit from 1.2.7 making it even better. @Binding@s now wrap their @Definition@ instance adopting its API. Moved the binding_for_definition mechanics to the respecting @Binding@ subclass.
* Added :readable and :writeable to #property: while @:readable => true@ renders the property into the document @:writeable => true@ allows updating the property's value when consuming a representation. Both default to @true@.

h2. 1.2.7

* Moving @Format.binding_for_definition@ to @Format#{format}_binding_for_definition@, making it an instance method in its own "namespace". This allows mixing in multiple representer engines into a user's representer module.

h2. 1.2.6

* Extracted @HashRepresenter@ which operates on hash structures. This allows you to "parse" form data, e.g. as in Rails' @params@ hash. Internally, this is used by JSON and partly by YAML.

h2. 1.2.5

* Add support for YAML.

h2. 1.2.4

* ObjectBinding no longer tries to extend nil values when rendering and @:render_nil@ is set.
* In XML you can now use @:wrap@ to define an additional container tag around properties and collections.

h2. 1.2.3

* Using virtus for coercion now works in both classes and modules. Thanks to @solnic for a great collaboration. Open-source rocks!

h2. 1.2.2

* Added @XML::AttributeHash@ to store hash key-value pairs in attributes instead of dedicated tags.
* @JSON::Hash@, @XML::Hash@ and @XML::AttributeHash@ now respect @:exclude@ and @:include@ when parsing and rendering.

h2. 1.2.1

* Deprecated @:represent_nil@ favor of @:render_nil@.
* API change: if a property is missing in an incoming document and there is no default set it is completely ignored and *not* set in the represented object.


h2. 1.2.0

* Deprecated @:except@ in favor of @:exclude@.
* A property with @false@ value will now be included in the rendered representation. Same applies to parsing, @false@ values will now be included. That particularly means properties that used to be unset (i.e. @nil@) after parsing might be @false@ now.
* You can include @nil@ values now in your representations since @#property@ respects @:represent_nil => true@.

h2. 1.1.6

* Added @:if@ option to @property@.

h2. 1.1.5

* Definitions are now properly cloned when @Config@ is cloned.

h2. 1.1.4

* representable_attrs is now cloned when a representer module is included in an inheriting representer.

h2. 1.1.3

* Introduced `#compile_fragment` and friends to make it simpler overriding parsing and rendering steps.

h2. 1.1.2

* Allow `Module.hash` to be called without arguments as this seems to be required in Padrino.

h2. 1.1.1

* When a representer module is extended we no longer set the <code>@representable_attrs</code> ivar directly but use a setter. This makes it work with mongoid and fixes https://github.com/apotonick/roar/issues/10.

h2. 1.1.0

* Added `JSON::Collection` to have plain list representations. And `JSON::Hash` for hashes.
* Added the `hash` class method to XML and JSON to represent hashes.
* Defining `:extend` only on a property now works for rendering. If you try parsing without a `:class` there'll be an exception, though.

h2. 1.0.1

* Allow passing a list of modules to :extend, like @:extend => [Ingredient, IngredientRepresenter]@.

h2. 1.0.0

* 1.0.0 release! Party time!

h2. 0.13.1

* Removed property :@name from @XML@ in favor of @:attribute => true@.

h2. 0.13.0

* We no longer create accessors in @Representable.property@ - you have to do this yourself using @attr_accessors@.

h2. 0.12.0

* @:as@ is now @:class@.

h2. 0.11.0

* Representer modules can now be injected into objects using @#extend@.
* The @:extend@ option allows setting a representer module for a typed property. This will extend the contained object at runtime roughly following the DCI pattern.
* Renamed @#representable_property@ and @#representable_collection@ to @#property@ and @#collection@ as we don't have to fear namespace collisions in modules.

h2. 0.10.3

* Added @representable_property :default => ...@ option which is considered for both serialization and deserialization. The default is applied when the value is @nil@. Note that an empty string ain't @nil@.
* @representable_attrs@ are now pushed to instance level as soon as possible.

h2. 0.10.2

* Added @representable_property :accessors => false@ option to suppress adding accessors.
* @Representable.representation_wrap@ is no longer inherited.
* Representers can now be defined in modules. They inherit to including modules.

h2. 0.10.1

* The block in @to_*@ and @from_*@ now yields the symbolized property name. If you need the binding/definition you gotta get it yourself.
* Runs with Ruby 1.8 and 1.9.

h2. 0.10.0

* Wrapping can now be set through @Representable.representation_wrap=@. Possible values are:
  * @false@: No wrapping. In XML context, this is undefined behaviour. Default in JSON.
  * @String@: Wrap with provided string.
  * @true@: compute wrapper from class name.

h2. 0.9.3

* Removed the @:as => [..]@ syntax in favor of @:array => true@.

h2. 0.9.2

* Arguments and block now successfully forwarded in @#from_*@.

h2. 0.9.1

* Extracted common serialization into @Representable#create_representation_with@ and deserialization into @#update_properties_from@.
* Both serialization and deserialization now accept a block to make them skip elements while iterating the property definitions.

h2. 0.9.0

h3. Changes
  * Removed the :tag option in favor of :from. The Definition#from method is now authorative for all name mappings.
  * Removed the active_support and i18n dependency.
